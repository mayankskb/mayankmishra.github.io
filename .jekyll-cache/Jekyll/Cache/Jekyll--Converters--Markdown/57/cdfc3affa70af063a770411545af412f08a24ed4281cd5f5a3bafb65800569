I" <p>While a three-year-old child has a lot to learn about the world, one thing that he is already an expert in is making sense of what he sees. Our society is more technologically advanced than ever. We’ve sent people to the moon, have phones that can talk to us, and have radio stations that can be customized to play the music of our choice. Yet our most advanced machines still struggle at interpreting what it sees.</p>

<p>We have prototype cars that can drive for us, but they cannot differentiate between a crumbled paper bag on the road and a stone that should be avoided. We have fabulous megapixel cameras, but we have not delivered sight to the blind. Security cameras are everywhere but they cannot detect when a child is drowning in the swimming pool.</p>

<p>As a society, we are collectively still blind when our machines are blind.</p>
